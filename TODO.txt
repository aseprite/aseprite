Refactoring
-----------

- Separate the source code in independent libraries:
  1) jinete -> third_party/vaca (it has the core for mutex/threads)
  2) sprite-core
  3) file-io
  4) undo
  5) aseprite
- editors_ -> Editors class widget
- rename core/cfg.h to cfg_file.h
- convert all widgets to classes:
  + match Jinete design with Vaca library (Vaca Fusion)
  + move all functions (jwidget_*) to methods in Widget class.
  + the same for each widget (e.g. jbutton_* to Button widget)
  + AppHooks to Vaca::Signals
  + Convert all JI_SIGNAL to Vaca::Signals
- all member functions should be named verbNoun instead of verb_noun or noun_verb.
- all functions to handle an object should be converted to member functions:
  - e.g. jwidget_set_text -> Widget::setText

High priority work
------------------

+ Selection tools do not have "move" functionality incorporated yet as we talked (they just add/subtract selection)
+ The following tools do not work: spray, eraser, blur, jumble, eyedropper, scroll, move.
+ You cannot cancel trace pressing the other mouse button
+ "shade" drawing mode
+ A lot of tool configurations are not working (grid, tiled, opacity)
+ Improve polygon tool (and polygon lasso)

- Fix paste behavior:
  + paste when there are no images (create one image or put the
    clipboard as the layer's image)
  + create a 'floating' flag for image-layers and make the
    trasformation embedded in the editor
  + Ctrl+T should transform the current cel
- fix bilinear: when getpixel have alpha = 0 get a neighbor color.
- fix sliders in Tools Configuration, they are too big
  for small resolutions.
- rewrite palette-editor to edit multiple-palettes.
  - fix quantize (one palette for all frames, one palette per frame)
  - pal-operations (sort, quantize, gamma by color-curves, etc.);
  - complete palette operations, and palette editor (it needs a slider
    or something to move between palette changes)
- add undo support for palette changes.
- brush options by tool.
- if there is activated the Tools Configuration dialog box, the
  Shift+G and Shift+S should update it
- when press Plus/Minus pad in the editor and the configuration tool
  window is active, the slider of the "Brush Size" must be updated.
- add two DrawClick2:
  - DrawClick2FreeHand
  - DrawClick2Shape
- see the new Allegro's load_font
- finish ICO files support.
- add "size" to GUI font (for TTF fonts);
- layer movement between sets in animation-editor;
  + add all the "set" stuff again;
- fix algo_ellipsefill;
- view_tiled() should support animation playback (partial support:
  with left and right keys).
- make keys like 9, 0, + Pad, - Pad configurable.

Wish-list
---------

- dacap wish-list:
  + added starred file-items in the file-selector.
  + the commands should use a new ase/ API and not the raster/ low-level
    - "raster/Undoable" is the beginning
  + the dependencies should be:
    commands/ -> ase/ -> raster/ -> jinete/
  + consistent error handling (now I'm using exception).
- manuq wish-list:
  + layer-with-constant-cel
- Mateusz Czaplinski ideas:
  + when move selections, will be good the possibility to see relative
    position from the starting point of movement;
  + make drawing the 'marching-ants-rectangle' a prioritaire thing to
    draw (when move it).

Low priority stuff
------------------

- add more unit-tests.
- test routines: load/save_pic_file, load/save_msk_file,
  load/save_col_file.
- fix the fli reader (both Allegro and Gfli): when a frame hasn't
  chunks means that it's looks like the last frame;
- talk with Ben Davis, his "quantize.c" has memory leaks (test it
  more, I don't think so);
- talk with Elias Pschernig, his "do_ellipse_diameter" (algo_ellipse)
  has a bug with ellipses of some dimensions (I made a test, and a
  various sizes have errors).
- optimize the *_to_allegro image methods (I profiled ASE, and these
  are the more slow routines in all the program);
- remove the jfilesel.c & jquickmenu.c
- fix Jinete examples:
  + 05fsel
  + 09lists
  + 20combo
  + 21manage
