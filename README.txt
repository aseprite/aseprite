===================================
INTRODUCTION
===================================

  ASE is a program specially designed with facilities to create
  animated sprites that can be used in computer games. You can
  create static images, characters with movement, textures,
  patterns, backgrounds, logos, color palettes, tiles, etc.

  What makes ASE different? It focuses on pixel editing, to do
  pixel-art. Indeed, it isn't a photo retouching tool or a vector
  graphics editor. Mainly it is a tool to create tiny animations
  pixel-by-pixel.
