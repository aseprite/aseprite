Introduction

   This is the end-user version of the Allegro game programming library:
   if you want to run third-party Allegro applications, this package holds
   everything you need.
   It contains just the system wide library framework (to be installed in
   /Library/Frameworks). It does not hold the library sources, tools and
   examples, nor any documentation. If you plan on using Allegro to code
   your programs, you are really encouraged to download and use the full
   library at the official Allegro website:
<p>
   <link>http://alleg.sourceforge.net</a>
<p>
   On the site you'll also find the documentation and links to a lot of
   Allegro-related resources.

Copyright

   Allegro is gift-ware. It was created by a number of people working in 
   cooperation, and is given to you freely as a gift. You may use, modify, 
   redistribute, and generally hack it about in any way you like, and you do 
   not have to give us anything in return. However, if you like this product 
   you are encouraged to thank us by making a return gift to the Allegro 
   community. This could be by writing an add-on package, providing a useful 
   bug report, making an improvement to the library, or perhaps just 
   releasing the sources of your program so that other people can learn from 
   them. If you redistribute parts of this code or make a game using it, it 
   would be nice if you mentioned Allegro somewhere in the credits, but you 
   are not required to do this. We trust you not to abuse our generosity.
