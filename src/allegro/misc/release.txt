Wrapping up Allegro How-TO for 4.4 branch
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Here are a list of steps when making a release.  It's expected you're
running on Linux with the necessary software installed.  Some of the sample
commands use git to access the SVN repository but svn would work as well.

*  Look over the SVN change log and update docs/changes._txt and
   docs/thanks._txt.  Commit the updates to the SVN repository.

   git log tags/OLDVER.. | less

*  In the allegro root directory, run `python misc/genexamp.py'. If the
   output looks good, apply the output adding ` | patch -p0' to the
   previous command and commit docs/src/allegro._tx.

*  Set the version number and commit.

    misc/fixver.sh 4 4 1

*  Tag SVN repository:

    git svn tag 4.4.1
    git svn dcommit

    or

    svn cp https://alleg.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/alleg/allegro/branches/4.4 https://alleg.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/alleg/allegro/tags/4.4.1

NOTE: svn doesn't retain timestamps when you use svn up or svn co.  IMHO it's
best for files to keep the timestamp of the last change that was made in
SVN -- a little bit of history.  You might want to do the next step
from an `svn export'ed directory, which does preserve timestamps.

So from here I have a script that does:

    - svn checkout from a local copy of the SF repository
    - svn update (to get more recent changes)
    - svn export to a fresh directory
    - run zipup.sh

*   Make .zip distro. Have the previous archive in parent directory.
    You will need to have the dat tool in your path.

    misc/zipup.sh all441.zip all440.zip

    The generated archives will be in the .dist subdirectory.

*   Upload all packages to Sourceforge.

    lftp sftp://${USER},alleg@frs.sourceforge.net:/home/frs/project/a/al/alleg

*   Announce the new release to the Allegro mailinglist:
    <alleg-main@lists.sourceforge.net>, make sure you add URLs to both the
    Allegro homepage and the Allegro sourceforge download page.
    Also include the release notes and anything else you wish to add.

*   Announce on Allegro.cc.

*   Bump version number, and commit changed files.

    misc/fixver.sh 4 4 2 SVN
    git commit -a -m "Bumped version to 4.4.2 (SVN)"
    git svn dcommit

*   Update the web site.
